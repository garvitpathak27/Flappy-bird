# Flappy Bird Game

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java Swing and AWT. The game features a bird that the player controls with spacebar to avoid obstacles (pipes) and score points by passing through them.

## Features

- **Smooth Background Scrolling:** The background moves continuously to give the illusion of movement.
- **Pipe Generation:** Pipes are generated at regular intervals with a gap to navigate through.
- **Bird Mechanics:** The bird can jump when the spacebar is pressed and is affected by gravity.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions between the bird and pipes to determine game over.
- **Score System:** The score increases as the bird successfully passes through pipes.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have JDK 8 or above installed on your system.
- **IDE (Optional):** Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) can be used for running and modifying the code.
